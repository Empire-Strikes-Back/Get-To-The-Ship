heroes must first unite, then go to the ship

my world is this:

four heroes accidentally come together and set off to find vitaal ship

one - el - comes from a sandy planet with traditions so suffocating she chooses to leave - she disobeys her family and has to run days through desert to fly off planet
one - cee - is an older civil officer who has his life set but realizes it's empty and seeks something he does not know yet, he leaves the service and joins a ship as a crew
one - bib - is an adventurous avanturist, do-first think-later, who is running from yet another trouble, he does not want to go, but joins out of spite and curiosity
one - ar - comes from a grey rocky isolated planet on the outskirts, he builds receiver to listen to galactic frequencies and learns about the ship, he sets off to find it

heroes never programmed before, but face challenges on their way they have to program - they learn as they go:

el has to assemble and program an out-of-order ship she finds to take off from her planet
ar builds and programs receiver to connect to galactic internet
cee lies that he can and joins a ship crew as engineer - he has to learn to program transport ship's systems
bib has to program doors to escape from capture of this time more serious trouble he is in
