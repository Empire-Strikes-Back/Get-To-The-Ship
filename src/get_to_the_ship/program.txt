i am get-to-the-ship program, i say:

my world is this:

four heroes accidentally come together and set off to find vitaal ship

one - el - comes from a sandy planet with traditions so suffocating she chooses to leave - she disobeys her family and has to run days through desert to fly off planet
one - cee - is an older civil officer who has his life set but realizes it's empty and seeks something he does not know yet, he leaves the service and joins a ship as a crew
one - bib - is an adventurous avanturist, do-first think-later, who is running from yet another trouble, he does not want to go, but joins out of spite and curiosity
one - ar - comes from a grey rocky isolated planet on the outskirts, he builds receiver to listen to galactic frequencies and learns about the ship, he sets off to find it
