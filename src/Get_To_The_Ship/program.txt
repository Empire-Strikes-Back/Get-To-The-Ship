i am Get-To-The-Ship program, i say:

i have only back-and-white canvas and repl
my repl is clojure repl
my repl swing text area, input is one line
i do not limit or alter player eval in any way - my repl is complete unabridged access to me as program
my window is fixed size and is no more that third of screen
i have no settings
player sees me in my entirety within window, no scrolling
player sees me in my entirety from start, all revealed
i am simple, i have few details
i have no time
i have no tiles, coordinates or distances
i have no concept of money or fight for resources

my world is this:

El, Ar, Bib and Cee coincidentally turn up on one of newer planets, each as part of their own separate party, uncoordinated
due to unforseen circumstances by all parties, they have to get to the one working ship that was part of droid expedition (ship is automated), it will get parties back to orbit to their ships
each of four parties has one working device left - a small terminal with screen showing map of the planet, location of droid ship and other three terminals
parties realize by seeing other blinking dots that there are others in similar situation (parties never met or coordinated - they just see terminal)
each party makes a move "in turn" and observe where others moved - all without communication understanding that all four parties want to get to the ship and making moves taking others into account

one - El - comes from a sandy planet with traditions so suffocating she chooses to leave - she disobeys her family and has to run days through desert to fly off planet
one - Cee - is an older civil officer who has his life set but realizes it's empty and seeks something he does not know yet, he leaves the service and joins a ship as a crew
one - Bib - is an adventurous avanturist, do-first think-later, who is running from yet another trouble, he does not want to go, but joins out of spite and curiosity
one - Ar - comes from a grey rocky isolated planet on the outskirts, he builds receiver to listen to galactic frequencies and learns about the ship, he sets off to find it

heroes never programmed before, but face challenges on their way they have to program - they learn as they go:

El has to assemble and program an out-of-order ship she finds to take off from her planet
Ar builds and programs receiver to connect to galactic internet
Cee lies that he can and joins a ship crew as engineer - he has to learn to program transport ship's systems
Bib has to program doors to escape from capture of this time more serious trouble he is in
